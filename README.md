# EcoMore

This is a project for the Big Red Hacks 2022 Hackathon at Cornell Univeristy.

Team members: Mena Attia, Nada Attia, Youssef Attia, Mohammad Labadi

## Summary

EcoMore is an app that promotes sustainability by turning it into a mass movement, exploiting the concept of the network effect, where more people are encouraged to be sustainable through the app in order not to be "left out", which is how social media platforms function.

The incentive this app uses to get users to sign up is cash rewards for reaching certain milestones in the app.

## Getting Started

To run this app, run `yarn install` in the frontend folder, followed by `yarn start`.

In order to run the backend, you need permissions and credentials to access the Google Cloud Vision API project. Please contact Mena for more information.

### Notes

This code was developed for the hackathon by the team members and was not borrowed from other sources, other than the Material-UI API and Demo Code, such the code used for the Avatar in `frontend/src/components/Profile.tsx`.
